            The term “hen” is used to refer to the female chickens or other female birds which belong to the order of Galliformes. Chickens are omnivorous birds, they feed on insects, lizards, seeds and food grains. Chickens are one of the most widely found domesticated farm birds. They live together in groups called “flocks” and their young ones are called “chicks”. The chickens we see nowadays are descendants of the wild variety of chickens of the Gallus Gallus family which are also called red jungle fowl. If the ancestry is traced back even further, chickens are related to a group of dinosaurs called the theropods. In fact, the latest research shows that chickens are 58% genealogically related to the now extinct carnivore Tyrannosaurus Rex. In this article on the Vedantu website, students will learn about the scientific name of hens, breeds of hens and their uses.
